### Install the Marauder Flash
[This is the link to install the Marauder Flash](https://github.com/SkeletonMan03/FZEasyMarauderFlash)

It's recommended to flash the Marauder Flash to the flipper development using Linux or Mac OS.

[Windows have an issue for quite some time, so it's recommended to run on Linux or MacOS](https://github.com/SkeletonMan03/FZEasyMarauderFlash/issues/33)

Make sure to choose option 2! That option will allow you to save the `.pcap` file to the SD card.

After that, use 7zip to extract the file.

Then open the command prompt and type in the following command:
